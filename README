Framwork for local product-database
-----------------------------------

This framework is based on top of icecat.biz, who offer a great database with product information. as smb-retailer, we needed this information to pimp our data.
So this is how it works:
	* the base stock is build on the data from data-prod-stat.xml, which is offered by icecat, status 1
	* the icecat_fetch.php take a status 1 or 5 entry from db, fetches the xml(.gz), saves it locally and sets the status to 10 on success, to 2 if it fails. 5 is taken first, so there is some kind of prioritized fetch.
	* the icecat_parser.php loads a status 10 entry from db, takes the file and parses most data from it. sets the status to 20 on success, to 5 on fail. on 5, it deletes the xml also.
	* the daily-script loads the daily-changes, marks files as 4 if they are deleted on icecat, to 5 with deletion of xml-file for refetch if something has changed.

so you will likely find many fragments from the initial mysql-based work.
